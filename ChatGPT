           <h1> Welcome to ChatGPT </h1>
        <p> ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot developed by OpenAI and released in November 2022. The "Chat" in the name is a reference to it being a chatbot, and the "GPT" stands for generative pre-trained transformerâ€”a type of large language model (LLM). ChatGPT is based upon OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 foundational GPT models, and has been fine-tuned (an approach to transfer learning) for conversational applications using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. </p>
